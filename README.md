# MNIST-NN
This is just standard program written in Lua and Torch that trains a couple of models on MNIST dataset (the black-white hand written numbers). Available models are linear NN, Multi Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network. There is also a demo file in ipynb that requires iTorch to work.
